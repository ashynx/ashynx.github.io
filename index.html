              - My name is not actually ashyn. It's just a name I like. Since
              it's the voice that matters, not who owns it. This is a websites I
              made mainly for expressing my thoughts and opinions.
            </p>
            <p>
              - There are concepts I have heard throughtout my life and I felt
              some of them were interesting and true and some of them were
              wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Hence I want to write about these topics stating what science
              has to say about it and expressing my personal opinions on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I will mainly write about topics related to science, technology
              and myths
