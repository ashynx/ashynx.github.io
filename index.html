            - My name is not actually ashyn. It's just a name I like. Since it's
            the voice that matters, not who owns it. This is a websites I made
            mainly for writing my thoughts and ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            - There are concepts I have heard throughtout my life and I felt
            some of them were interesting and true and some of them were wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Hence I want to write about these topics stating what science has
            to say about it and expressing my personal opinions on it.
