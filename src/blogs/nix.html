            <p>
              - NixOS is a declarative linux distribution, it is based on nix
              packet manager allowing reproducibility and portability.
            </p>
            <p>
              - It's different from other distribution because of it&apos;s non
              FHS compliance and configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The whole configuration for the system is written inside a
              single configuration file <code>configuration.nix</code> - You can
              also find a <code>hardware-configuration.nix</code> which you
              probably never have to edit. It contains the configuration for the
              hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
              - After modifying the configuration files, you can run
              <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code> to apply the changes or you
              can run <code>sudo nixos-rebuild test</code> to test the changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> command creates a new
              generation, So in case the system break, You can rollback to a
              previous generation.
            </p>

              - Nix is a purely functional packet manager that allows for
              declarative installation of packages.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Nix can be used as a packet manager, not just in NixOS, in other
              linux distribution and even in MacOS.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Packages in nix are built from nix expressions, which is a
              simple functional language.
            </p>
            <p>
              - It allows multiple versions of the same package to be installed
              but due to its hashing scheme, They don't interfere with each
              other.
            </p>
            <p>

          <p class="text-[#8caaee] text-2xl">What is Flakes?</p>
          <div class="md:text-lg text-[#c6d0f5] flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p>
              - Flakes is an experimental yet popular feature in NixOS that
              allows the pinning of versions of the dependencies making the
              system more reproducible.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The version is pinned in a <code>flake.lock</code> file and the
              flake expression is written in a <code>flake.nix</code> file.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The pinned versions can be updated to a higher version with the
              <code>nix flake update</code> command.
            </p>

          <p class="text-[#8caaee] text-2xl">What is Home-Manager?</p>
          <div class="md:text-lg text-[#c6d0f5] flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p>
              - Home manager helps in managing user environment using the nix
              packet manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Home-Manager can be installed as a module or a standalone
              installation.
            </p>
            <p>
              - It allows you to configure the configs of user specific
              utilities. For example, You can write the config for hyprland
              using home-manager so that when you build the system, The configs
              will be applied automatically.

              - I personally think NixOS is a great linux distribution that
              combines stability and recency.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Since it&apos;s non-FHS compliant, it might be hard switching to
              it initially. But once you get a hang of it, You are good to go.
            </p>
            <p>
              - This one might be the best distro for ricing since you can rice
              without the fear of breaking your system. If you do break it, just
              rollback.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I did have issues setting few things up, which I can tell was a
              nightmare.
            </p>
            <p>- Not at all a beginner friendly distro.</p>
            <p>
              - The learning curve is very steep but that depends on how deep
              you go. NixOS can be a rabbit hole.
            </p>
            <p>
              - You will have an exact idea on what's on your system since you
              are configuring almost everything declaratively.
            </p>
            <p>- Best logo out of all other distros</p>
